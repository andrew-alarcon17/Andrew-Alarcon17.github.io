<p>This project was the final project for the BrainStation Data Science Bootcamp. Students were allowed to pick any topic of their choice, so I decided to create a project that classifies movie genres.</p>
<p>IMDb is a website that contains information on thousands of movies and shows that have been released over the years. Each movie or show has its own description and genre to go along with it. Through the perspective of someone who make’s their own movie or show, you would want to adequately create a description that captures the genre of your work. The importance of this subject matter is that if a movie’s genre is labeled appropriately, it would gain the attraction of viewers who are interested in that particular genre. However, if a movie is labeled inappropriately, it may throw off a viewer who watches a movie thinking its of a particular genre, but instead was something that they are not interested in. Predicting the genre of a movie/show using the description is the core of the problem that I will be trying to solve in this report. From this point forward in the report, I will calling every data entry (movies and shows) in the dataset as ‘movie’ for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<h2 id="inspecting-the-dataset">Inspecting the Dataset:</h2>
<p>This data set was downloaded from Kaggle, which was collected via the IMDb API.  The dataset consists of movie titles, it&rsquo;s genres, and descriptions. However, there were a few formatting issues when taking a first look at the data. Upon inspection, I discovered that there weren’t appropriate column names. What the data file had as column names were actually the first row of the dataset. So, I moved this information to be the actual first row of the data set, and appropriately named the columns as “Movie”, “Genre”, and “Description”.</p>
<p>Another detail about the data set that I found suspicious was that the release year of the movie was in the title column as well. For example, it would look like the following: The Dark Knight (2008). I decided to extract the years information and store them in a new column called “Year”.</p>
<h2 id="data-preprocessing--exploratory-data-analysis">Data Preprocessing &amp; Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<p>After formatting my desired columns, I moved onto preprocessing my data in order to gain efficient insights about it. I was curious to see what the genre population was like in my dataset, and discovered that the genres “documentary”, “drama”, “comedy”, “shorts”, and “horror” were the most frequently appearing genres in the dataset. Upon this discovery, I was very interested to see the most relevant words used in these genres.</p>
<p>But before I went into finding the most relevant words in genres specifically, I was curious to see what were the most frequently used words across the entire dataset. So I decided to vectorize my data set using the Count Vectorizer (which excluded stop words like “the”, “to”, “it” etc.) and then ended up plotting this information.
Here, the most common words in the corpus are “life”, “film”, and “new&rdquo;. However, the word “life” has a significantly higher count than the rest of the words.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andrew-alarcon17.github.io/Movie_Plots_Vis/CV.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>As for the specific genres, I wanted to find the most relevant words amongst the top 5 genres in the dataset. Doing so involved tokenizing each genre using the TF-IDF vectorizer. In notebook 2 of this project, you will find all 5 charts to compare, but for this report I will display my results to the most weighted words found in “documentary”, shown below.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andrew-alarcon17.github.io/Movie_Plots_Vis/TFIDF.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>Looking at this chart, “film” is the most weighted token in the corpus of documentary movies. The word “documentary” is in second place, and the word “life” following up.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I decided to vectorize the entire dataset using the TF-IDF vectorizer to prepare it for the modeling process. Stop words were excluded from the corpus, as well as having all of the words lowercased and punctuation removed.</p>
<h2 id="modelling">Modelling</h2>
<p>Several models were created and compared to each other. For this project, I focused mainly on two types of models: Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Classifier. Before fitting my models, I used the MaxAbsScaler to scale my data. I used this because my training and testing data were sparse matrices, and didn’t want to get rid of the sparsity in my data when scaling.</p>
<p>When building my Logistic Regression, I found it important to pick an appropriate range of values for hyper parameters to be passed through Grid Search. The best hyper parameters chosen were “C=10”, “max_iter=2000”, and “solver=‘liblinear’”. After finding an optimal model using Grid Search, I wanted to see how the performance of my model would change by reducing the dimensions of the independent variables by using Principal Component Analysis. After reducing the dimensions.</p>
<p>As for the Random Forest Classifier, I wanted to find a good range of values for hyper parameters like “min_sample_leaf”, “max_depth”, and “n_estimators” that would be passed into Grid Search as well. The chosen hyper parameters were “max_depth=100”, “n_estimators=100” and “min_sample_leaf=1”.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>The Logistic Regression model made from the hyper parameters chosen by Grid Search ended up having a training accuracy of 51.5% and a testing accuracy of around 49.9%. The behavior of the Precision and Recall caught my attention as well. Since the genres “documentary” and “drama” were the most abundant genres in the dataset, they tended to have the highest Precision and Recall. This Logistic Regression model turned out to be the best performing model in my project, however, I deem it important to discuss about the next Logistic Regression model I made using Principal Component Analysis.</p>

<p>In this second model, I was able to reduce the dimensions of my data set from 281 features to 231 features, while also being able to keep very close performance to the previous Logistic Regression model discussed above. This PCA Logistic Regression had a training accuracy of 50.7% and a testing accuracy of 49.7%. In terms of the classification report, when looking at looking at (for examples) “documentary”, the Precision remained the same and Recall decreased by .01, and for “drama”, the Precision fell by .01 and the Recall remained the same. Although the performance is technically worse than the optimal Logistic Regression, the performance is still very very close given that the dimensionality was reduced.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion--next-steps">Conclusion &amp; Next Steps</h2>
<p>In this report, I documented the steps I took in order to run machine learning models to classify the genres of movies based off of their descriptions. I cleaned and preprocessed the data by removing any unwanted stop words and punctuation, and vectorized the data with the TF-IDF Vectorizer to gather the most relevant words in the dataset. My final model ended up being a Logistic Regression model that had a training accuracy of 51.5% and a testing accuracy of around 49.9%.</p>
<p>When I compare these results to my initials goals, I was underwhelmed by the performance of my models. Even after tuning the hyper parameters of several models, I struggled to reach accuracy scores better than 51%. Reflecting after all the work that I had done, I think one major issue in this data set is how unbalanced the classes are. There are 26 genres in the data set, and 5 of them take up the majority of the data entries. I think if the data set was more balanced, then the performance of these models would have been better.</p>
<p>There are a few possible next steps after this project is finished. One would be to deploy this model onto a web app using Flask and Heroku that allows anyone to enter a movie/show description and have it classified using this Logistic Regression model. Another possible step would be to create an even better model using Recurrent Neural Networks via GPT3 and OpenAI. This model would then be used for production on a web app like how I mentioned previously.</p>
